/**
 * Annotates a method in a {@literal @}{@link Pointcut} class that should be run just before each
 * method execution picked out by the {@link Pointcut}. Only one method in a
 * 
 * {@literal @}{@code Pointcut} class may be annotated with {@literal @}{@code OnBefore}.
 * <p>
 * An {@literal @}{@code OnBefore} method can accept parameters annotated with any of the following:
 * {@literal @}{@link BindReceiver}, {@literal @}{@link BindParameter},
 * 
 * {@literal @}{@link BindParameterArray} or {@literal @}{@link BindMethodName}.
 * <p>
 * An {@literal @}{@code OnBefore} method may return {@code void} or a non-{@code void} type. If it
 * returns a non-{@code void} type, the value returned by the {@literal @}{@code OnBefore} method is
 * called the <em>traveler</em>, and is available as input to subsequent
 * 
 * {@literal @}{@link OnReturn}, {@literal @}{@link OnThrow} and {@literal @}{@link OnAfter} methods
 * by annotating a parameter on any of these methods with {@literal @}{@link BindTraveler}.
