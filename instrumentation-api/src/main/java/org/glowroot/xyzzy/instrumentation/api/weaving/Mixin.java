/**
 * Annotation to designate a class as a mixin class. The fields and methods from the mixin class
 * will be added to the target types. The target types can include interfaces, in which case the
 * annotated class will be mixed in to all classes which implement any of those interfaces.
 * <p>
 * If the mixin class implements any interfaces, those interfaces will be added to the target types.
 * This is the recommended way to access methods that are mixed in to the target types.
 * <p>
 * Constructors are not mixed in to the target types, but a single method in the mixin class can be
 * annotated with {@literal @}{@code MixinInit} and this will be called exactly once at some point
 * during the construction of each target type (to be precise, it is called at the end of each
 * target type constructor that doesn't cascade to another constructor in the same type).
 * <p>
 * It's important to note that inline field initializers in the mixin class will not get added to
 * the target types (since at the bytecode level they are be part of the mixin constructor), so
 * field initializers must be placed in the {@literal @}{@code MixinInit}.
